$P = -\left(\frac{\partial E}{\partial V}\right)_T$

- the energy of two phases changes differently with volume

- Here you can see there are volumes where the relative stabilities change

- The common tangent gives us the transition pressure

- Energy to separate neutral atoms in their ground electronic state from the solid at 0K at 1 atm.

1. Is the formation of an alloy at a particular composition and structure energetically favorable?

2. Given two alloy structures at the same composition, which one is more stable?

3. Given a set of alloy structures at different compositions, which ones are stable with respect to phase separation?

We need to compute reaction energies, eg:

A + 2B \rightarrow AB_2

\(\Delta H = E_{AB_2} - E_A - 2E_B \)
and then see if they are exothermic.

Let us consider alloy structures of Cu and Pd

- first, two structures of the same composition [[file:/home-research/jkitchin/06-640-s14/course/dft-book/dft.org::50-50-cu-pd][file:~/06-640-s14/course/dft-book/dft.org::50-50-cu-pd]]


- Next, another structure [[file:/home-research/jkitchin/06-640-s14/course/dft-book/dft.org::alloy-cu3pd][file:~/06-640-s14/course/dft-book/dft.org::alloy-cu3pd]]
  - Is this structure favorable?
  - is it more favorable than two separate phases?

- One more Cu_{3}Pd structure [[file:/home-research/jkitchin/06-640-s14/course/dft-book/dft.org::alloy-cu3pd-2][file:~/06-640-s14/course/dft-book/dft.org::alloy-cu3pd-2]]
