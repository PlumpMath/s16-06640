We think of surface formation from bulk schematically like this:

[[/home-research/jkitchin/06-640-s14/course/dft-book/images/surface-construction.png]]

Then, we define the surface energy as if it is a reaction:

$\sigma = \frac{1}{2}(E_{slab} - \frac{N_{slab}}{N_{bulk}} E_{bulk})$

We may also normalize by the area or by number of surface atoms.

- It takes some care to do this to avoid non-cancelling errors in slab and bulk energies due to incommensurate k-points

- Sometimes there are quantum size effects from the thin slabs

** Advanced topics in surface energy

The surface energies can be used to estimate the shapes of nanoparticles using a Wulff construction. See citealp:doi.10.1021/jp200950a for an example of computing Mo_{2}C surface energies and particle shapes, and cite:Inoglu2009188 for an example of the influence of adsorbates on surface energies and particle shapes of Cu.

- Asymmetric slabs have dipole moments [[file:/home-research/jkitchin/06-640-s14/course/dft-book/dft.org::asymmetric-slab][file:~/06-640-s14/course/dft-book/dft.org::asymmetric-slab]]

- periodic dipoles can lead to an electric field that affects the electron density, and consequently the energy

- a dipole correction scheme was invented to correct this

- An electric field is placed in the vacuum to exactly balance this effect

- we use incar:IDIPOL to turn it on
  - you specify what direction to have the field in
