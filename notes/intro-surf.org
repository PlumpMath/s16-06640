#+TITLE: Introduction to surfaces

- We model surfaces as /slabs/

- That is like a bulk unit cell, but with some vacuum space in one dimension, and continuity in the other directions.

- There are always *2* surfaces
  - They are not always identical

- Surfaces are classified by Miller indices (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_index)

- The simple, flat surfaces are fcc(111), fcc(110), fcc(100), bcc(110), bcc(100), hcp(0001)

- There are built in functions for fcc111, bcc110, bcc111, hcp001 and diamond111.

atoms = fcc111('Al', size=(2,2,3), vacuum=10.0)

- this leads to new parameters to test for convergence
  - Number of layers
  - Amount of vacuum space
  - Size of the unit cell

* Vicinal surfaces
- These are "high" Miller index surfaces
- They have steps and kinks

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from ase.lattice.surface import surface
from ase.visualize import view

# Au(211) with 9 layers
atoms = surface('Au', indices=(2, 1, 1), layers=9, vacuum=5)
atoms.center()

view(atoms)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

- Here the idea of a layer needs explaining
  - It is related to the d-spacing

- These unit cells can get large very quickly

- Slabs are not like the bulk in electronic structure
- In the plane of the slab, they are similar to bulk
  - atoms overlap, and there are bands with significant dispersion

- Normal to the slab, however, there is no band dispersion
  - the bands are flat [[file:../dft-book/dft.org::surface-bands][file:../dft-book/dft.org::surface-bands]]

- That means we use M \times N \times 1 k-point grids where there is 1 k-point in the direction normal to the slab (usually the $z$ direction)

* Simple surface calculations

- Surfaces break translational symmetry
- Surface atoms are undercoordinated compared to bulk atoms and in an unsymmetric way
- This leads to forces on surfaces constructed from bulk termination by vacuum
- We can use geometry optimization to reduce the forces
- This leads to /surface relaxation/ if the atoms do not fundamentally change positions

- See [[file:../dft-book/dft.org::*Surface%20relaxation][Surface relaxation]]

- Sometimes there are more stable arrangements of atoms at the surface than the bulk termination
- This is called [[file:../dft-book/dft.org::*Surface%20reconstruction][Surface reconstruction]]
  - We can estimate the probability of this by thinking of the energy change for this reaction
  - bulk-terminated surface \rightarrow reconstructed surface
