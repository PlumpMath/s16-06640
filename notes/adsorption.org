* Surface energies

[[../dft-book/dft.org::*Surface energy]]

- We compute the energy required to create surface area

From the reaction:

Bulk → slab with surfaces

* Adsorption

Simplest case:

Surface + molecule → Surface + adsorbates

Same as before, we compute the (energy of products) - (energy of reactants).

New factors to consider:

- How many adsorbates

- What is the adsorbate configuration?

- What is the concentration/coverage of adsorbates?
