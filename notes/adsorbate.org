* Project 2 notes
1. We are doing a progression of projects
 - Project 1 was well-defined by me
 - Project 2 is defined by a paper
 - Final project is defined by you

I do not want a literature review like the first one you did. For project two, there should be a brief (1/2 page) summary of the key results, and another summary of how the paper did the calculations (1/2 page).

You do not need to repeat everything in the paper. You do need to convince me that you can spot the most important results, and reproduce those.

It should take less than a week to run all the calculations. The rest of the time should be spent on the analysis and writeup.

Presentations will be short.
1 slide on Introduction
1 slide on what you are calculating and how
1 slide with comparison of paper figures and your figures
1 slide to conclude

You should not have more than 6 slides, as you have only 9 minutes.

All presentations are due at the same time. Presentation order will be determined randomly. Jake will load all the presentations (powerpoint, pdf or emacs+org-mode) onto a laptop.

- The adsorption energy is the change in energy between a molecule in the gas phase, and the molecule on a surface

- Physisorption
  - Relatively weak interaction with surface
  - Molecule is only slightly perturbed in structure

- Chemisorption
  - Relatively strong interaction with surface
  - Molecule strongly perturbed in structure
  - Molecule may dissociate

slab + gas-phase molecule \rightarrow slab_adsorbate + products

- We have to make many decisions in calculating adsorption energies

  - What surface?
  - What site? (fcc, hcp, bridge, top, step, ...)
  - How big should the unit cell be? Does it matter?
  - what other adsorbates are present?
  - How should we constrain the atoms?
  - How thick should the slab be?

- To explore these questions let us calculate the dissociative adsorption energy of O_2 on Pt(111) in different sites

  - Pt(111) + 1/2 O_2 \rightarrow Pt-O(111)
  - we consider the fcc, hcp, and bridge sites
  - we will use a 2 \times 2 unit cell with three layers
  - We will freeze the metal atoms

\( \Delta H_{ads} (eV/O) = E_{slab+O} - E_{slab} - 0.5*E_{O_2} \)

- We setup each calculation in its own section.
- We only run the calculation in these sections. We will compute adsorption energies later.

- Once these are done we can get the adsorption energies
[[file:/home-research/jkitchin/06-640-s14/course/dft-book/dft.org::*Analysis%20of%20adsorption%20energies][Analysis of adsorption energies]]

- We learn that the fcc site is more favorable than the hcp site
- The bridge site is not stable

- We can still calculate the bridge site if we use constraints
  - We have to constrain the O atom so it only moves in the z-direction

- Limitations of these calculations
  - frozen slab
  - thin slab
  - We did not consider convergence
  - fixed coverage

- Let us consider effect of coverage: [[file:/home-research/jkitchin/06-640-s14/course/dft-book/dft.org::*Coverage%20dependence][Coverage dependence]]
- We look at the adsorption energy at 1 ML

* [[file:/home-research/jkitchin/06-640-s14/course/dft-book/dft.org::*Adsorbate%20vibrations][Adsorbate vibrations]]
- We use IBRION=5 in conjunction with constraints to get the vibrational modes that we want.

- Vibrations also tell us about the stability of a site
