- So far we have only considered the total energy in our thermodynamic calculations

- The total energy is like the internal energy \U\ at absolute 0 K (but at what pressure?)

  - In the ideal gas limit the internal energy is independent of pressure (no interactions between molecules)

- We may want to consider the effect of pressure and temperature

- For example, we know that oxides decompose above some temperature

- qualitatively that means the reaction energy for

M + O_2 \rightarrow MO_2

becomes endothermic for some T

- Recall:

H = U + pV
G = H - TS

- We need some ways to estimate these

- First, let us examine how significant the effects of P and T might be on the energy of an O_2 molecule

- We look at the Shomate polynomials that approximate entropy and enthalpy as a function of temperature first.

- Let us apply the ideas to the formation energies and bulk stability of Cu and Ag oxide.

$2Cu + 1/2 O_2 \rightarrow Cu_2O$
